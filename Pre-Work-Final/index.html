	<p id="selfintro"> You can call me Greg! My pronouns are both she/her and he/him, with a preference for the masculine. I won't be upset if you use feminine terminology to refer to me.

	I was a licensed Massage Therapist and an Account Manager previously, before I decided to try going into tech at the suggestion of my doctor. I love to read (fiction books are my favorite) and I have a pet dog named Casey.</p>

	<p>Some of my favorite things include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sewing</li>
			<li>Video Games</li>
			<li>Pad Thai</li>
		</ul>

	<p id="Caseylink">I look forward to learning so much more in this program, and to anyone curious, I am always open to talking about pets/dogs (especially <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.744568045594965&type=3">mine</a>!).</p>
