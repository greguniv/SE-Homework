	<h4 id="Caseyintro">Casey is a 7 year old Chihuahua. It is unknown if she is a mix or purebred, but we don't hold it against her!</h4>
	<p>Casey was adopted at 5 weeks of age in 2014, bought from a garage sale, where she and her brothers and sisters were being sold. She was the runt of the litter and it was speculated she wouldn't live for very long.

		As you can see, she has more than defied those expectations, as she is a healthy 7 years of age, weighing in about 10 pounds (though you wouldn't guess it from looking at her).</p>
